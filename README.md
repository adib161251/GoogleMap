# GoogleMap

----------GOOGLE MAP Development---------

Here, I've inserted marker on my current location. When I click on the marker the modal pop wil apear, then It'll ask
2 inputs. Current location(which will be added from the map on the form) and Your Name. After Clicking the Enter button, the data will passed on console. 
I also added one thing if you Click Elsewhere on the Map, then It'll also ask
2 inputs. Current location(which will be added from the map on the form) and Your Name
